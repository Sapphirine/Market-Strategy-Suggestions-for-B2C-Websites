We used 2 methods to analyze the dataset, so there are 2 folders, each is a java maven project. You could go to http://secret-beyond-5169.herokuapp.com to see the outcome of our analysis.

We run the 2 projects in Eclipse. The output of GroupPeopleByCar will be in 'testdata' folder. While when you run Clusterer, after the clustering job is done, the program would ask for input, then you could choose to print points, cluster information, or give information of a specific person to see which cluster he belongs to.

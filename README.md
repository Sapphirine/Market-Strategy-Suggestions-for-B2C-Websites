Market-strategy-suggestions-for-B2C-websites

Overview

There are 3 folders, 2 of them are java maven projects, since we used 2 methods to analyze the dataset. The other folder 'bigdata' contains the Ruby on Rails project for the website. You could go to http://secret-beyond-5169.herokuapp.com to see the outcome of our analysis.

Usage

We run the 2 projects in Eclipse. The output of GroupPeopleByCar will be in 'testdata' folder. While when you run Clusterer, after the clustering job is done, the program would ask for input, then you could choose to print points, cluster information, or give information of a specific person to see which cluster he belongs to.
